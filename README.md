# miniref: Minimalist Reference Management Using the Command Line
miniref is an experiment at creating an **academic reference manager** (in the sense of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)), but for the **command line** and with a **minimalist flavour**. It is strongly inspired by projects like [Cobib](https://mrossinek.gitlab.io/programming/introducing-cobib/) and [fast-p](https://github.com/bellecp/fast-p) (the latter which appears to originate the idea of using `fzf` for searching PDF literature).

**Note: This is an alpha stage project**.

# Requirements
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (available in many OS package managers) - for `refsearch.sh`
* Standard Unix/Linux shell utilities (originally developed under OpenBSD 7.3 against `sh`; strict compatibility not guaranteed).
* Python 3 - for `refadd.py`
* xpdf

# Installation
* Copy [scripts](scripts) to a location on your `$PATH` (e.g. `~/bin`. Redefine `PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin` if necessary)
* Install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
* Optional: `export MINIREF_HOME=/path/to/my/references` in your `.profile` (defaults to `$HOME/miniref`)
* Optional: Add [suggested aliases](aliases/aliases) to your shell config (e.g. `.bashrc`)
  
# Introduction
The central idea is that each reference is a directory with a human-interpretable and meaningful name that we will call the **reference identifier**. A suggested naming scheme is *firstAuthorSurname* + *publicationYear* + *firstTitleKeyWord*. For example, we might use *turing1936computable* as the reference identifier for A.M. Turing's 1936 paper *"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"*.

# Currently Implemented Features
miniref currently implements the following features:

## Adding a Reference
```
refadd.py -e -s https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf turing1936computable
```
creates the directory `turing1936computable` at location `$MINIREF_HOME` and populates the newly created directory with the specified PDF file (both HTTP(S) URLs and local paths are supported). In addition, the newly created directory is populated with a minimal `ref.ris` file, for storing bibliographic information (e.g. author, title, publication year) in [RIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)) format. Thus, `$MINIREF_HOME` now looks like this:
```
miniref/
`-- turing1936computable
    |-- Turing_Paper_1936.pdf
    `-- ref.ris
```
In the previous command, the optional `-e` flag further opens `ref.ris` in `$EDITOR`, for manual entry of bibliographic information. 

Instead of relying solely on manual RIS data entry, it is alternatively possible to fetch RIS data automatically, by providing a DOI:
```
refadd.py -s https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf -i doi:10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230 turing1936computable
```
**Note**: We can invoke `refadd.py` multiple times on the same reference identifier `turing1936computable` (for example, if we want to edit existing bibliographic information, or include additional files.)

## Navigating and Searching References
Use `refsearch.sh` to search using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). You should see something like this:

![screenshot](screenshots/rs.png)

The left-hand pane displays a list of references. Given a selected reference, the right-hand pane displays:
* **Bibliographic information** (`ref.ris`)
* **List of files** (e.g. `.txt` files, PDFs)
* **Notes** (`cat` of `.txt` files)

**Incremental search** (i.e. by typing) is currently applied to:
* Reference identifiers (and reference paths)
* Contents of `ref.ris` for each reference
* Contents of any `.txt` files (e.g. notes) for each reference

**Hitting Enter â†µ opens a shell** at the selected reference.

**Hitting F1 opens the first PDF** (if available), given the selected reference.

# Roadmap
* Tagging
* PDF full-text search / keyword extraction
